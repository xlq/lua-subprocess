lua-subprocess
==============

== Introduction

`lua-subprocess` is a Lua module that allows you to create child processes and
communicate with them. The API is based on Python's subprocess
module, but is not yet as complete.

== Compatibility

Tested under Windows, Linux and Wine. Needs more testing.

== Functions

==== subprocess.popen { arg1, arg2, ..., [options...] }
Creates a child process with the arguments arg1, arg2 etc. Options
are table items with string keys. The valid options are:

    * `executable` - If set, this is used as the actual executable
    to run, while `arg1` becomes `argv[0]` of the child process.
    If not set, `arg1` is used as the executable name.
    * `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` - These identify what to use
    as the standard input/output/error files of the child process.
    If not specified, the handle(s) from the parent process are used.
    Each of these options can have the following types:
        ** `string` - the option specifies a filename that is opened
        for reading (for stdin) or for writing (for stdout or stderr).
        ** `number` - specifies an open file to use. The file
        is not closed by popen in the parent process.
        In POSIX, this value is a file descriptor.
        In Windows, this value is a Windows API handle.
        ** `FILE*` - a Lua file object can be used. This file is not
        closed by popen in the parent process.
    The following constants can also be used:
        ** `subprocess.PIPE` - a pipe is created, and the relevant end
        is given to the child process. A Lua file object is placed in
        the returned proc object. For stdin, the read end is given to
        the child process and stdin is set to a writable file in the proc
        object. For stdout or stderr, the write end is given to the child
        process and stdout/stderr is set to a readable file in the proc
        object.
        ** `subprocess.STDOUT` (only for stderr) -
        This can be used to redirect the standard error file to the
        standard output.
    * `close_fds` _(boolean)_ If true, all file descriptors (except
    standard input, output and error) are closed after forking, but
    before calling exec, so that the child process doesn't inherit these
    file descriptors. On Windows, this does nothing.
    * `binary` _(boolean)_ If true, binary mode is used for files returned
    to the caller. This disables CR/LF translation. On POSIX, this does nothing.
    * `cwd` _(string)_ Names a directory for the child process to be
    run in.
`subprocess.popen` can throw Lua errors when something goes horribly
wrong. For normal errors, however, it returns `nil, errormsg, errno` (errno
may or may not be nil, depending on the nature of the error).

===== Return value
On success, returns a proc object (see <<procobj,below>>).
On failure, returns `nil, errormsg, errno`.

==== subprocess.call { arg1, arg2, ..., [options...] }
Creates a child process in the same way as `subprocess.popen` but waits
for the child to finish executing, then sets and returns the `exitcode`.

WARNING: Do not set `stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr` to `subprocess.PIPE`
when calling `subprocess.call`, as it will deadlock when a pipe buffer
is filled.

===== Return value
Returns `exitcode`. See: <<exitcode,exitcode>>.

==== subprocess.call_capture { arg1, arg2, ..., [options...] }
Creates a child process in the same way as `subprocess.popen` but reads
all data from the child's standard output and returns it. If you want to
capture stderr as well, set `stderr` to `subprocess.STDOUT`.

WARNING: Do not set `stderr` to `subprocess.PIPE`, it can deadlock.

WARNING: `subprocess.call_capture` captures all the child process's output
into memory, so if the child produces a huge amount of output, memory might be
exhausted.

===== Return value
Returns `exitcode, content` where `content` is a string containing the captured output.

==== subprocess.wait()
Waits for any child process to exit.

===== Return value
On success, returns `proc, exitcode, pid`. I'm not sure why you'd want the
pid after the process has finished, though.

On failure, returns `nil, errormsg`.

WARNING: On POSIX operating systems, `subprocess.wait` calls the `wait` system
function. If you create child processes without using the subprocess module,
and the `wait` system call returns a pid without a corresponding proc object,
then the returned proc object will be `nil`.
Furthermore, the process will be removed from the process table and the `waitpid`
system call should not be used for that pid again.

[[procobj]]
== Proc objects

==== proc.pid
This is set to the process identifier of the child.

WARNING: On POSIX systems, do not use this value with the `waitpid` system
call, because you will make the subprocess module use an invalid pid
in future system calls. In fact, the `wait` system call will have this effect
too, so don't use it while subprocess's child processes are running.

==== proc.stdin, proc.stdout, proc.stderr
These are set to file objects if the corresponding option passed to
`subprocess.popen`, was set to `subprocess.PIPE`. Note that if
the `stderr` option was set to `subprocess.STDOUT`,
`proc.stderr` will not be set.

[[exitcode]]
==== proc.exitcode
After `proc:poll`, `proc:wait` or `subprocess.wait` discovers the child process has
terminated, this field is set to the exit code of the child process. Before then,
it is `nil`.
If `proc.exitcode < 0` then the child was killed by signal number 
`-proc.exitcode`.

==== proc:poll()
Checks if the child process has terminated. If the child process has terminated,
this sets `proc.exitcode` and returns it. If the child process is still running,
this returns `nil`.

==== proc:wait()
Waits for the child process to terminate, then sets and returns the
`exitcode` field.

==== proc:send_signal(sig) _(POSIX only)_
Sends a signal to the child process.

==== proc:terminate()
Terminates the child process. On POSIX, itsends `SIGTERM`. On Windows,
it calls TerminateProcess.

==== proc:kill()
Kills the child process. On POSIX, it sends `SIGKILL`. On Windows, it
is the same as `proc:terminate()`.

== TODO ==
* Support of other operating systems.
* Deadlock-free way of communicating.
